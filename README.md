# CodingChallenge
This program is a search engine that displays Github Repositories and keeps a history of previous searches. To use the app, you simply type any key search term in the search box and 4 columns of information appear in the table representing information about that repository. A drop down menu on the right displays history your previous searches and when clicked on will trigger the query for the repositories. I've learned some important things from this project such as refreshing my knowledge on how to leverage API's to gather mass amounts of information and sort it instantly. Another thing that definitely challenged me a little bit was refactoring a lot of my code to fit the search history and querying from clicking a value in the drop down menu. A lot of the code used to query from the drop down menu and when typing it in the search box were the same, so I created multiple methods so it could be leveraged by both cases. Overall this project went pretty well and hope to do more in the future.
